                <h2>About us</h2>
                <p>The Big List of Communism is a web directory that aims to list all websites of the communist dissidence, paying particular attention to the left-wing of this dissidence, also known as "left-communism". Despite what some may say, this category encompasses an extremely broad range of positions, some of them contradictory. As such, the requirement for a website to be included in our listings is a simple one: adherence to the concept of the international proletarian revolution, and the rejection of, or adversity towards, the two mainstream currents born from the post-revolutionary USSR, known vulgarly as "stalinism" and "trotskyism".</p>
                <p>Our effort is not born from a dedication towards any particular conception of the communist program we feature, that is to say, we try to be "unbiased". Our objective is to provide ease-of-access to these websites, which have a lackluster presence on mainstream search engines.</p> 
                <p>We also have a wider goal of preservation, which this list helps us accomplish. Eventually, we plan to provide website feeds and snapshots, along with making them searchable in some form, in order to both facilitate archival and reduce dependence from those websites on embedding mainline search services. This, of course, involves not creating a dependency on our services either. This effort should arrive at an index format that can be processed individually.</p>
                <p>Today, we are still refining the list and adding more things to it. If you'd like, you can help via checking out the <a href="/community.html">Community page</a>.</p>
